Features and fixes planned for development.

-  Warn users about setting transition animations time > timeout in both usage section and console
-  Add explanation of how the library works and credit learning sources

### Ideas

Ideas I have thought up but will not add unless [requested](https://github.com/{{ socialHandles.github }}/{{ pkg.name }}/issues/new/choose).

-  Add event hooks:
   -  onChange()
   -  afterChange()
-  Add previous()

Have a feature request? Create a [new issue](https://github.com/{{ socialHandles.github }}/{{ pkg.name }}/issues/new/choose) and select the "Feature request" type OR write the feature yourself and create a pull request.
