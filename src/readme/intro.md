## Intro

Would you like to...

-  Randomly change backgrounds on your website?
-  Smoothly rotate through a collection of CSS background images, colors, and/or gradients?
-  Change backgrounds on 1337 elements simultaneously?! (not recommended but doable ðŸ˜‚)
-  Impress your website visitors?

Try out {{pkg.details.stylizedName}}.js!

The {{pkg.details.stylizedName}}.js library lets you specify what HTML element(s) to add a background changer to, what CSS backgrounds to use, and more. It is usable in the browser and more environments are coming soon.
